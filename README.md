This repository contains my notes, PDFs, and practice work based on **Abdul Bari's Data Structures & Algorithms lectures**.  
I’m learning and documenting concepts step by step to strengthen my foundation in DSA.

## What I’ve Learned So Far- **Chapter 1**

- Introduction to Time Complexity & Space Complexity
  - Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ notations
  - Analyzing algorithms with respect to input size
  - Space vs Time trade-offs

## Repository Structure

## chapter02 abdul bari dsa concepts

Time complexity for loops ,

Example Usage
Main Topic: Time Complexity Analysis
Key Points:

Learned about Big O notation
Understood worst case analysis
Practiced calculating time complexity

Important Concepts:

Big O: Upper bound of algorithm performance
Time Complexity: How runtime increases with input size

Examples:

for (i=0 , i<n , i++){ ----> always run n+1 times
  <!-- some statement --> -----> always run n times under for loop
}
 eventually it'll  lastly follows the O(n) time complexity ,

Big O helps compare algorithms
Always think about worst case
Practice more examples needed
