#  DSA Concepts — Abdul Bari

This repository contains my notes, PDFs, and practice work based on **Abdul Bari's Data Structures & Algorithms lectures**.  
I’m learning and documenting concepts step by step to strengthen my foundation in DSA.

## What I’ve Learned So Far
- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to Time Complexity & Space Complexity
  - Big-O, Big-Ω, Big-Θ notations
  - Analyzing algorithms with respect to input size
  - Space vs Time trade-offs
